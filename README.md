# DIY, low cost Raspberry Pi Pico Macro-Keys firmware

This repository contains the firmware source code for a low-cost macro keys pad built with the [platform.io](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/what-is-platformio.html) framework and the Raspberry Pi Pico.

The firmware has been written in such a way that it is very easy to adapt to your own needs.
Currently it is primarily used as a Microsoft Teams macro pad.
